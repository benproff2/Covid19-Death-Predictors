# Covid19-Death-Predictors
Developed a machine learning–based COVID-19 mortality prediction system using the CDC COVID-19 public dataset, which contains patient-level clinical, demographic, and outcome information. The project aimed to estimate the likelihood of death due to COVID-19 while comparing multiple classification models on real-world public health data.
